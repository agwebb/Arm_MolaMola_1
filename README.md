# Arm_1
first rendition of the arm, an arduino based and C++ driven arm that is capable of being directed through potentiometer controls or inverse kinematics and set parameter values.

the goal of this arm is to learn movement through inverse kinematics and potentiometer direct control.
After the arduino based movement I am looking to move to a Raspberry Pi 4B as this would enable me to implement ROS 2 and to take advantage of the faster processing speed and of the Pi. 

this project is started, organised, designed, and completed by Andrew G. Webb
