# Arm_1
first rendition of the arm, an arduino based and C++ driven arm that is capable of being directed through potentiometer controls or inverse kinematics and set parameter values.

the goal of this arm is to learn movement through inverse kinematics and potentiometer direct control.
After the arduino based movement I am looking to move to a Raspberry Pi 4B as this would enable me to implement ROS 2 and to take advantage of the faster processing speed and of the Pi. 

this project is started, organised, designed, and completed by Andrew G. Webb


progress report:

i seem to have forgotten to document up until the point of september 4th.

sept 4, 2024:
the arm now has a set base design as well as a set initial servo to pipe joint connection. the next thing to be pritned tomorrow is a base for the arm. this has been designed but not printed yet. It'll be printed tomorrow as a 4 hour and 44 minute print. 
the goal is to print this and finish designing the pipe connectors and gripper. 
the set goal for the arduino based arm is to have an arm that can reach across the entirety of my table and can be used as a handy assistant for holding objects.
the idea is to have a mini to scale version of the arm that is activated with a button press, the button will have the if condition satisfied and only then will the arm update its pot and servo values. 

i would like for the gripper to have good articulation and wide variety gripping abilities.
